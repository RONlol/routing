# routing
my personal routing for v2rayn(possibly v2rayng and others) that if possible only handles domains(i wont promise this but i will update readme and routing when i can)
please share your issues  suggestion  ip ranges and domains for apps you need i will add them to routing the main routing or another json or .txt file
there are 3 ways to import routing to v2ray clients
v2rayn:
1st:using link of githubusercontent.com as optional link(i will update this for better understanding
2nd:as json file
3rd:copying the raw file then clicking on Import From clipboard option in rule list setting
more to come...
